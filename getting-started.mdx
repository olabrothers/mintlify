Sip is a design tool that allows you to collect, organize, and edit colors. It also gives you the ability to share colors with everyone and link them between the other tools in your workflow.

Designed to be fast and unobtrusive, there when you need it and gone when you don’t.

Created by [Olá Brothers](https://theolabrothers.com), and it’s available for  Mac.

## **Minimum Requirements**

Sip requires macOS **Sonoma** or newer.

## **Download Sip**

Ready to try Sip? Download the free trial [here](https://sipapp.io/downloading) and test it for 15 days. Once your free trial period ends, you’ll be prompted to purchase a license.

## **Purchasing Sip**

If Sip is the right tool for you, you can purchase it directly from our [store](https://sipapp.io/pricing).

Each license includes **one year of updates** and is priced **per device**. You only pay for what you actually use.

The price per device decreases based on the total number of devices you license.
