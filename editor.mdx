The **Editor** offers a powerful and seamless experience for managing your palettes and colors. You can easily:

- Edit colors with precision.
- Rename colors.
- Create new palettes or colors based on existing ones.

## Edit a Color

The **Editor Modal** provides flexible tools for editing a color:

- Use the universal **Color Picker**.
- Enter values directly in the **HEX field**.
- Adjust the individual **RGBA** (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) channels.

### Color Picker

Select a color visually by clicking and dragging within the color space. Adjust:

- **Hue**: The color family.
- **Saturation**: The intensity of the color.
- **Brightness**: The lightness or darkness.

### Hue and Opacity Sliders

- **Hue Slider**: Adjust the base color along the spectrum.
- **Opacity Slider**: Control the transparency, from fully transparent (left) to fully opaque (right).

### Color Values

Fine-tune your colors with precision:

- **RGBA**: Adjust each color channel:
  - `R` = Red
  - `G` = Green
  - `B` = Blue
  - `A` = Alpha

Your changes update in real-time as you adjust these values.

### Actions

Manage your colors with ease:
