Designing for accessibility just got easier.

In this major release, we've introduced full support for simulating how colors appear to people with different types of color vision deficiencies. With a single toggle, you can now preview your palettes through the lens of:

- **Normal** – Standard color perception
- **Protanopia** – Red-weak vision
- **Deuteranopia** – Green-weak vision
- **Tritanopia** – Blue-yellow color blindness
- **Achromatopsia** – Total color blindness (no color perception)

## Why this matters

Color blindness affects over 300 million people worldwide. With this new feature, you can:

- Instantly simulate different types of color vision
- Validate accessibility in your designs
- Ensure your palettes are inclusive and legible for everyone

Whether you're a designer, developer, or accessibility advocate, this tool helps you build better, more inclusive visuals—right from inside Sip.

You'll find the new simulation modes in the Toolbar. Pick one to see your palettes transform in real time.

## Change Color Blindness Mode from the Menu

The **Color Blindness** simulation options are available directly from the app menu, allowing you to quickly toggle between modes like Normal, Protanopia, Deuteranopia, Tritanopia, and Achromatopsia.

## Change Color Blindness Mode from the Main Window

The **Color Blindness** simulation modes can also be accessed from the Main Window. Simply select the mode you want from the Toolbar or the Palettes List to instantly preview how your colors appear to users with different types of vision.

## See Color Blindness Preview in the Picker

When you select a simulation mode, the Color Picker updates in real time to reflect the chosen mode (like Tritanopia). This helps you preview and validate your color choices for accessibility right inside the app.
