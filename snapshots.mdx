Easily backtrack and restore your work with **Snapshots** in Sip. Whether you accidentally deleted a color or made unwanted changes, Snapshots help you go back to a specific point in time.

## What Are Snapshots?

Snapshots capture the state of your color data at a particular moment. Think of them as backups for your palettes.

You can access Snapshots by going to:

- **Preferences > Snapshots**

## How Snapshots Work

- Sip automatically creates Snapshots based on your selected frequency.
- You can also manually create a Snapshot at any time.

## Creating Snapshots

You can select how often Sip automatically saves Snapshots:

- **Never** - No automatic snapshots will be created.
- **Minute** - A new snapshot is created every minute. Ideal for frequent changes.
- **Hour** - A new snapshot is created every hour. Perfect for regular backups.
- **Day** - A new snapshot is created once a day. Suitable for less frequent updates.

The Snapshots view shows:

- A list of Snapshots with their creation time, size, and actions.
- Action buttons to:
  - **Export** a Snapshot
  - **Delete** a Snapshot

## Resetting Snapshots

If you want to start fresh, click **Reset Snapshots** at the bottom. This removes all existing Snapshots and lets you configure a new schedule.

<Tip>
	<b>Example:</b> Use Reset Snapshots when you want to clear all previous backups and start a new history.

## Why Snapshots Matter

Snapshots ensure your work is always safe. Whether you need to recover a palette from a week ago or undo a change from five minutes ago, Snapshots make it possible.
