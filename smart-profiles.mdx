**Smart Profiles** â€” Context-Aware Color Picking

With **Smart Profiles**, Sip automatically adapts to the environment you're working in by applying the correct color profile behind the scenes.

## Why Smart Profiles Matter

When picking a color on your screen, the result can vary depending on the color profile of the app or window you're sampling from:

- Web browsers like **Safari** and **Chrome** often use **sRGB IEC61966-2.1**.
- Native macOS apps like **Xcode** and **Sketch** may use **Display P3** or **Generic RGB**.

Without the correct profile, your picked colors may not match what you see in your designs. **Smart Profiles** solves this by ensuring:

- The correct color profile is applied automatically.
- Your colors are accurate and consistent across apps.
- You save time by letting Sip handle the technical details.

## Setting Up Smart Profiles

1. Go to **Preferences > Smart Profiles**.
2. Enable **Use Smart Profiles**.
3. Add apps (e.g., Safari, Chrome, Xcode) using the **+** button.
4. Choose the appropriate color profile for each app from the dropdown.

That's it! Sip will now automatically switch profiles based on where you're picking colors from.
